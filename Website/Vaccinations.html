								In December 2020, vaccine global regulating governing bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration started approving the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Companies like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson were
								able to quickly manufacture mass doses of their vaccines in order to start administrations.

									<h4>Countries with the Most People Fully Vaccinated</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Since December 2020, there has been a clear push in order to fully vaccinate people globally. 
									As some vaccines require two doses, nations around the world are being pressured to fully vaccinate its citizens as quickly as possible in order to reach an end of this global pandemic. 
									As seen in this graph, the United States are dramatically leading in terms of total vaccine administration.

									<h4>Daily Vaccination Trends</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									This analysis shows how there was a sharp increase from December 2020 through June 2021. However, there is somewhat of dip from July 2021 through October 2021. 
									This dip can be explained by a few different factors. First, not enough people with access to vaccinations were getting the vaccine. 
									Second, vaccines were not being adequetly distributed globally.
									Third, there were not enough people left to get vaccinated after June 2021.

									<h4>People Fully-Vaccinated vs. New Cases</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
								After a year long period of new cases, testing, and death, vaccine administration is fully underway for nations around the world. 
								As seen in this visualization, it is clear that as vaccines became more readily available, cases generally started going down globally.
