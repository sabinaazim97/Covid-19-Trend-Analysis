										<h3>Daily Trend for New Tests</a></h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										In the beginning of pandemic, testing was difficult access globally because researchers were still trying to understand the virus. 
										Because testing was difficult to access, nations reported low numbers for daily tests. 
										However, it is clear that testing started rapidly increasing between May 2020 - December 2020. 
										Since December 2020, the daily testing trend has stayed somewhat level because testing is more easily accessible.

										<h3>Total Tests Performed vs. Number of Cases by Month</a></h3>

									<p>
										This graph takes a closer look at how many COVID-19 tests were administered compared to number of positive results recieved from those tests. 
										This graph shows how there was a closer margin between total tests and total cases in 2020. 
										However, testing for COVID-19 started increasing significantly in 2021 even though positive cases were only increasing slightly in comparision.

									<p>
											Testing helps nations understand how many cases are emerging in any given country. However, tests were not always readily available to the public.
											During the start of the pandemic, reporting of COVID-19 might not have been as accurate because testing was not always as accessible.
											Therefore, it is fairly possible that COVID-19 started spreading earlier and faster than actually reported by tests.
