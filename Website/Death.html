										<h3>New Deaths Per Month</a></h3>

									<p>
										This analysis shows how deaths were distributed throughout reported continents. 
										North America was leading in number of deaths for the beginning of 2021; however, it started to go down from May 2021-July 2021. 
										Asia took a drastic lead in the number of deaths during the summer of 2021. 
										However, Asia's death rates started decreasing again in August 2021.
										South America also saw a spike in COVID related deaths during the summer of 2021; however, like Asia, the death rates started slowing down again in August 2021.

											While hospitalization numbers are still high, death rates indicate that vaccinations might be helping loss of life. 
											This analysis; however, should not be percieved as the end of the fight against the virus. 
											Rather, it should show how vaccines and social distancing can help slow the spread of COVID-19.
